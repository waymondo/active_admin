## State of the project

1.0.0.pre5 is the last release to support Rails 3.2 and Ruby 2.0 or earlier.
It is provided to help with upgrades to Rails 4 only.

1.0.0.pre5 has support for Rails 5. The following Gemfile addition may be needed:

```ruby
gem 'inherited_resources', '~> 1.7'
```

1.0.0 will drop support for Rails 3.2 and Ruby 2.0 or earlier.

## Goals

1. Enable developers to quickly create good-looking administration interfaces.
2. Build a DSL for developers and an interface for businesses.
3. Ensure that developers can easily customize every nook and cranny.
